In a development department it is important to keep each other informed. This we do through the DevWiki, here you can find for example the information on how to get started on the different technologies we use or on the coding standards.

For this lesson we ask you to read the start page of the Wiki and after that the parts of the Wiki that describe the technologies you will use in your team.

You can find the DevWiki here:
